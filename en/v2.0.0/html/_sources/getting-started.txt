.. _overview:

Overview
--------

CDR-Stats is an application that allows you to browse and analyse CDR (Call Detail Records).

Different reporting tools are provided:

- Search CDR: Search, filter, display and export CDR.
- Monthly Report: Summarise and compare call traffic history month on month.
- Analyse CDR : Analyse and compare call volumes with the previous dayâ€™s traffic.
- Daily Traffic : Graph and filter traffic loads by hour during the day.

MongoDB is an open source, document-oriented database designed with both scalability
and developer agility in mind. Instead of storing your data in tables and rows as
you would with a relational database, in MongoDB you store JSON-like documents with
dynamic schemas. The goal of MongoDB is to bridge the gap between key-value stores
(which are fast and scalable) and relational databases (which have rich functionality).
