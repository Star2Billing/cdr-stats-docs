CDR-Stats is free and open source call detail record analysis and reporting software for Freeswitch, 
Asterisk and other type of VoIP Switch. It allows you to interrogate your CDR to provide reports 
and statistics via a simple to use, yet powerful, web interface.

It is based on the Django Python Framework, Celery, SocketIO, Gevent and MongoDB.

.. _overview:

Overview
--------

CDR-Stats is an application that allows you to browse and analyse CDR (Call Detail Records).

Different reporting tools are provided:

- Search CDR: Search, filter, display and export CDR.
- Monthly Report: Summarise and compare call traffic history month on month.
- Analyse CDR : Analyse and compare call volumes with the previous dayâ€™s traffic.
- Daily Traffic : Graph and filter traffic loads by hour during the day.

MongoDB is an open source, document-oriented database designed with both scalability
and developer agility in mind. Instead of storing your data in tables and rows as
you would with a relational database, in MongoDB you store JSON-like documents with
dynamic schemas. The goal of MongoDB is to bridge the gap between key-value stores
(which are fast and scalable) and relational databases (which have rich functionality).

CDR-Stats supports Freeswitch and Asterisk using connectors that get the CDR. Connectors
for other switch systems can be built. Additionally CDR-Stats features a CSV upload facility so that
CDR from virtually any source can be imported and analysed by CDR-Stats.

Dashboard
---------

User Dashboard helps the user to monitor in realtime the most relevant factors of his swiches.

Admin Panel
-----------

Admin Panels will allow the administrators to configure the entire reporting platform, import CDR in csv and much more.

.. _architecture:

Architecture
------------
 
CDR-Stats uses MongoDB as the underlying CDR store. MongoDB allows querying and analysis of many
millions of records without noticeable loss of performance, and can easily be scaled as demand increases.

One of the three popular databases (MySQL / Postgresql / SQLite) is used for managing CDR-Stats, 
such as users and managing the web framework, Django.

Celery, a task manager runs in the background, and monitors the CDR coming into the system, and alerts
the systems administrator when unusual behaviour is discovered. What is determined as unusual 
behaviour is determined by the administrator who can configure alerts for increases in dropped calls,
average length of calls, or calls to unusual destinations.

At the moment Freeswitch and Asterisk are supported, for other switches such as OpenSIPs or Kamailio, 
connectors can be built to connect to the CDR database store and import them in realtime to CDR-Stats.

.. _notes:

Notes for later
---------------

Freeswitch is supported using the mod_mongo module to write CDR directly into MongoDB. For other 
switches such as Asterisk, connectors can be built to connect to the switch's database store, such as
MySQL, SQLite, or Postgresql.

Features
--------
 
Many features are provided on CDR-Stats, from browsing millions of CDRs, providing efficient search to build rich reporting such as monthly reports, concurrent calls view, and comparing call traffic to previous days.

.. _utility:

Utility
-------

CDR-Stats is a simple-to-use tool to provide easy analysis of calls. It is a recommended addition to 
telephony servers, whether it be a simple in-house PBX or large capacity VoIP switch. It shows in 
in near realtime what calls are going through, can detect errors and failures, and alert the systems
administrator is unexpected traffic is noted.
