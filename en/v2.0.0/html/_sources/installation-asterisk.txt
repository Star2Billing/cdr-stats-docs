Installation via Script
=======================

Before commencing installation, it is necessary that Asterisk is configured to 
write CDR to a MySQL database. If this has not been done already, there are 
some resources to configure Asterisk to write its CDR records to MySQL at 
http://www.asteriskdocs.org/en/3rd_Edition/asterisk-book-html-chunk/asterisk-SysAdmin-SECT-1.html

It is wise to take a backup of the CDR database. A note needs to be taken of 
the CDR database name, the CDR table, as well as the MySQL root password as 
this will be required during the installation of CDR-Stats.

Run the following commands at the console::

    $ wget â€“no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/Star2Billing/cdr-stats/master/install/install-cdr-stats-asterisk.sh -O install-cdr-stats-asterisk.sh
    $ 
    $ bash ./install-cdr-stats-asterisk.sh


The install routine will ask a number of questions, all of which are self explanatory.
