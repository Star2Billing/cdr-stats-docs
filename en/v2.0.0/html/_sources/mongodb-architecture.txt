MongoDB is a scalable, high-performance, document-oriented schemaless 
database, everything in MongoDB is a document. There is no notion of a rigid table 
structure composed of columns and types. Because data in mongo is stored 
as documents, there are no joins. 

Instead of storing your data in tables and rows as you would with a relational database, 
in MongoDB you store JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. The goal of MongoDB is 
to bridge the gap between key-value stores (which are fast and scalable) and relational 
databases (which have rich functionality).

Why MongoDB
-----------

Why did we choose MongoDB and what are the benefits?
To answer this questions I think we should enumerate some of the major features of MongoDB.

**Document-oriented**:
    * Documents (objects) map well to programming language data types
    * Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for joins
    * Dynamically-typed (schema-less) for easy schema evolution
    
**High performance**:
    * No joins and embedding make reads and writes fast
    * Indexes including indexing of keys from embedded documents and arrays
    
    
**High availability**:
    * Replicating servers with automatic master failover

As MongoDB is a Document-oriented datastore, it had a huge potentiel to store 
CDR's, Call Detail Record formats vary between Telecom Switch types, For these 
reasons a NoSQL database is a very good candidate for a CDR warehouse.

Datastore Architecture
----------------------
 
The MongoDB aggregation framework provides a means to calculate aggregate 
values without having to use Map-reduce (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/MapReduce). 
For those familiar with SQL, the aggregation framework can be used to do 
the kind of thing that SQL does with group-by and distinct, as well as 
some simple forms of self-joins.

The aggregation framework also provides projection facilities that can be 
used to reshape data. This includes the ability to add computed fields, to 
create new virtual sub-objects, and to extract sub-fields and bring them to 
the top-level of results.

**update()** replaces the document matching criteria entirely with objNew. 

Shell syntax for update(): db.collection.update(criteria, objNew, upsert, multi)

Arguments:
    * **criteria** - query which selects the record to update
    * **objNew** - updated object or $ operators (e.g., $inc) which manipulate the object
    * **upsert** - if this should be an "upsert" operation; that is, if the record(s) do not exist, insert one. Upsert only inserts a single document.
    * **multi** - indicates if all documents matching criteria should be updated rather than just one. Can be useful with the $ operators below.


Shell syntax for $inc: { $inc : { field : value } }
Increments “field” by the number “value” if “field” is present in the object, 
otherwise sets “field” to the number “value”. This can also be used to 
decrement by using a negative “value”.


**1) cdr_common:** 
    To collect all CDR's from different switches & store into one common format which include the following fields 
    switch_id,  caller_id_number, caller_id_name, destination_number, duration, billsec, hangup_cause_id, accountcode, direction, uuid, remote_media_ip, start_uepoch, answer_uepoch, end_uepoch, mduration,
    billmsec, read_codec, write_codec, cdr_type, cdr_object_id, country_id, authorized.
    This cdr_common collection used to view cdr records on customer panel 


**2) cdr_monthly_analytic:**
    To collect monthly analytics from CDR's which include following fields 
    start_uepoch, destination_number, hangup_cause_id, accountcode, switch_id, calls, duration.
    This cdr_monthly_analytic collection is used to view monthly graph on customer panel
 
**3) cdr_daily_analytic:**
    To collect daily analytics from CDR's which include following fields start_uepoch,
    destination_number, hangup_cause_id, accountcode, switch_id, calls, duration.
    This cdr_daily_analytic collection used to view daily graph on customer panel.

**4) cdr_hourly_analytic:**
    To collect hourly analytics from CDR's which include following fields 
    start_uepoch, destination_number, hangup_cause_id, accountcode, switch_id, calls, duration.
    This cdr_hourly_analytic collection used to view the hourly graph on customer panel 

**5) cdr_country_report:**
    To collect country based analytics from the CDR which include following fields 
    start_uepoch, country_id, accountcode, switch_id, calls, duration.
    This cdr_country_report collection is used to view country graph on customer panel 

**6) concurrent_call:**
    To collect concurrent calls which include following fields 
    switch_id, call_date, numbercall, accountcode.
    This concurrent_call collection is used to view concurrent call real-time graph on customer panel
